# LEMAC-with-Love
LEMAC-(Lets Make a Change)with Love,My repository will be about a couple topics that cover(Q The Great Awakening) Qanon Movement & My Life living with HIV/AIDS for 33 years,the ups & downs of living with this, however it's given me a different perspective on how 2 view life. I am an Activist not just for HIV/AIDS but 2 my fellow brother & sister in the same fight against the stigma still attached to the virus. I also will be attempting 2 jump on the Q train . I understand we are in the last days & time is precious & while I am alive I want to help WAKE UP people to the Signs of the Times. Do not be deceived. The World needs to Love one Another , Love will mend & Love is coming soon.
