# LEMAC-with-Love
My reository will be about a couple topics that cover the Qanon Movement and My Life living with HIV/AIDS for 33 years, the ups and downs of living with this , however it's given me a different perspective onhow to view life. I am an Activist not just for HIV/AIDS but also my Love for my fellow brother &amp; sister in the same fight against the stigma still attached to the virus. I also will be attempting to jump on the Q train . I understand we are in the last days and time is precious and while I am alive I want to help WAKE UP people to the Signs of the Times. Do not be deceived. The World needs to Love one Another , Love will Mend and Love is coming soon.
